# One layer of an extraction (layout in README.md): row i of every file is the i-th sampled tile. The constructor sends nothing to `device`: the tensors are CPU tensors in memory
# (the big files `patch_tokens` and `image` are memory-mapped and only opened when enabled), all of them are private, and the two ways out, get_block (a whole small block) and DeviceLoader (batches, below), are the only
# places that move data to the device; __getitem__ returns one example as CPU tensors. A part that is not enabled is an empty tensor, so items always have the same keys.
# Only two facts are public: label_names and vector_types.
